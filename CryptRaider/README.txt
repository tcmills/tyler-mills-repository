Crypt Raider is an Unreal project I worked on during the Udemy class, "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games," in October 2022.

The C++ files that the player, moving wall, and pedestal use are in the C++ folder, pictures of the Blueprint files that the level and player use are in the Blueprint folder, and the CryptRaider video shows what the project does.
