The Space Shooter Pro is a Unity project I worked on during the Udemy class, "The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity," I took in July 2022.

I could not get the executable upload to this repository because some of the files it needed to run were too big for GitHub to upload.

The C# scripts that the game runs with are in the Scripts folder.
