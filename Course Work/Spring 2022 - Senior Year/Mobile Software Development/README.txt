Mobile Software Development was a class I took where I learned how to develop apps for iOS in Swift.

I used a Mac and the Xcode application to created these projects.

Projects Asg1-5, ME, and FE are my five projects, midterm exam, and final exam respectivley.

In the class, I was put onto a team of two other people and we spent half of the semester creating our final project, Diary.zip.
