Creative Computing Studio was my capstone class at Virginia Tech and what I wanted to specialize in.

In the class, I was put onto a team of three other people and we spent the semester creating our senior project.

The Final Blog Post.pdf is our desciption of what we created. It also includes a link to the GitLab repository for our project, which is: https://git.cs.vt.edu/kaleb18/probability-art-blackjack

The Stand-up Report.pdf is a report of what each person on our team did during classtime over the semester.
